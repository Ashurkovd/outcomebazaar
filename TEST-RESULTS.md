## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### MetaMask Tests
- **Issue:** Extension path configuration error
- **Error:** `The "path" argument must be of type string. Received undefined`
- **Impact:** MetaMask tests cannot run until extension is properly configured
- **Resolution:** Requires additional Synpress cache setup or manual extension path configuration

### Workarounds
All core functionality is verified through UI tests. MetaMask integration can be tested manually or requires:
1. Setting up MetaMask extension cache with `@synthetixio/synpress`
2. Configuring extension path in wallet setup
3. Running tests in headed mode with proper browser context
